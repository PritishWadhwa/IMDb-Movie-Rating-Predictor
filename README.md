##Introduction

Is  it  possible  to  predict  the  rating  of  a  movie  prior  to  its release  or  production?   Every  year  countless  movies  are made and released worldwide.  All these movies are given ratings by viewers throughout the globe.These ratings are combined together to form the IMDb ratings.   IMDb rat-ing is the singlemost influential factor in deciding any con-sumerâ€™s opinion and inherently the success of a movie.With the machine learning techniques at our disposal, we aim to predict the seemingly unpredictable IMDb rating ofany movie before its theatrical release. Successfully pre-dicting IMDb rating is beneficial for both producers (from afinancial standpoint) and consumers (from an entertainment standpoint) alike.

## Description and Implementation Details
In this repository, we have implemented various machine learning algorithms on our dataset.
